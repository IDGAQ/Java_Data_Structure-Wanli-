## Declare:
ArrayDeque <String> animals = new ArrayDeque<>();

## Change element:
```java
//add at the end
add(Object o)

//add at the beginning
addFirst(Object o)

//add at the end
addLast(Object o)

//offer works the same as add
//only difference is ⬇️
//if ArrayDeque is full, add()throws an exception, offer return false
offer()
offerFirst()
offerLast()

//
```
